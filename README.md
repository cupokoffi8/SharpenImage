# Image Sharpening Code
## *Compilation Guide*

###
To compile this program simply type in the terminal  g++ -g -std=c++11 finalTest.cc  `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`. This works for mac and linux  and we were unable to test it for windows as no one in the group has a windows pc. To run the program type ./a.out and pass the path to the image file you want to sharpen. For example ./a.out input.png. Once running follow the terminal messages to guide you in your image sharpening process.
